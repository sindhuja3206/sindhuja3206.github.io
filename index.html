                HTML is used for structural purposes on a web page, not functional ones. Programming languages have functional purposes. HTML, as a markup language doesn't really “do” anything in the sense that a programming language does. HTML contains no programming logic.

                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
